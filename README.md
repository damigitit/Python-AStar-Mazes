# Python-AStar-Mazes
Demonstrates maze generation, and also how the A* algorithm can be applied intelligently to solve mazes.
Uses Prim's algorithm to generate a random maze, draws it in Tkinter, and then solves it using the A* algorithm.
It all happens so quick!

The maze_generator.py script works as a standalone script and prints random mazes to text output.  maze_generator is also used with the AStarMaze.py Tkinter application, which draws the randomly generated maze to a canvas, and then draws out the solution after being solved by A*.

Note: The file "cool_maze.txt" came from an online source several years ago.  I don't remember where I grabbed it from, but I am crediting the creator of the pattern. This pattern served well to demonstrate A* here used for solving mazes, so I provide the text file/pattern along with my own implementation of A* and a photo of it being solved in the tkinter app I wrote.
